        "# Speckle Stream Cloning\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to clone a Speckle stream from one to another. It uses the Speckle SDK to interact with a Speckle Server and perform operations like fetching branches and commits, and cloning them into a target stream.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "- Speckle SDK: You can install it using pip (`pip install specklepy`)\n",
        "- A Speckle account: You'll need an account to access a Speckle Server. You can create one [here](https://speckle.systems/).\n",
        "- A Speckle Server URL and Personal Access Token: These are required to authenticate with the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "The main function for cloning a stream is `clone_stream()`, which takes the following arguments:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `source_stream`: The URL of the stream that you want to clone.\n",
        "- `target_stream`: The URL of the stream where you want to clone the source stream.\n",
        "- `server_url`: The URL of your Speckle Server (optional if you're using the default account stored on your machine).\n",
        "- `token`: Your Personal Access Token for the Speckle Server (optional if you're using the default account stored on your machine).\n",
        "- `max_commits`: The maximum number of commits that you want to clone from each branch (default is 1).\n",
        "- `max_branches`: The maximum number of branches the script iterates through (default is 100)\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how you can use the function:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "SERVER = 'your_server_url'\n",
        "TOKEN = 'your_token'\n",
